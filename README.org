#+title: AWSS

A Practical cli for list, get and batch get apis on AWS.

This cli tool provides list, get and batch get operations on AWS without
worrying about =NextToken=. Instead it fetches all of the resources.

Output is written to standard out and is mostly compatible with corresponding
AWS CLI output, so you could use a tool like `jq` in your command.

* Installation

#+begin_src sh
 brew install warfox/awss/awss
#+end_src

After installation this can be run by either `awss` or `awsss` command.

* Example

1. List Glue jobs
Following command will list all glue jobs in your account, using NextToken internally

#+begin_src sh
  awss glue list-jobs
#+end_src

2. Batch Get Glue jobs
Following command using the `BatchGetJobs`

#+begin_src sh
  awss glue batch-get-jobs
#+end_src
